3327,Computer Science and Engineering,"Researchers reveal AI weaknesses by developing more than 1,200 questions that, while easy for people to answer, stump the best computer answering systems today. The system that learns to master these questions will have a better understanding of language than any system currently in existence."
3328,Computer Science and Engineering,"The quest to replace Li-ion batteries could be over as researchers find a way to efficiently recharge Zinc-air batteries. The batteries are much cheaper, can store 5x more energy, are safer and are more environmentally friendly than Li-ion batteries."
3329,Astronomy,"An enormous black hole one hundred thousand times more massive than the sun has been found hiding in a toxic gas cloud wafting around near the heart of the Milky Way, which will rank as the second largest black hole ever seen in the galaxy, as reported in Nature Astronomy."
3330,Computer Science and Engineering,"Researchers show that socioeconomic attributes such as income, race and voting patterns can be inferred from cars detected in Google Street View. For example, if the number of pickup trucks is greater than the number of sedans, the neighborhood is overwhelmingly likely to vote Republican."
3331,Computer Science and Engineering,"Operating system and a film stored on DNA, and recovered with no errors."
3332,Computer Science and Engineering,"Nearly 70% of energy produced in the US each year is wasted as heat, and comes from things like computers. Engineers at UC, Berkeley, developed a thin-film system that can be applied to sources of waste heat to convert such heat from electronics into energy, as reported in Nature Materials."
3333,Astronomy,"Earth's Atmosphere Is Bigger Than We Thought - It Actually Goes Past The Moon. The geocorona, scientists have found, extends out to as much as 630,000 kilometres. Space telescopes within the geocorona will likely need to adjust their Lyman-alpha baselines for deep-space observations."
3334,Computer Science and Engineering,"Device pulls water from dry air, powered only by the sun. Under conditions of 20-30 percent humidity, it is able to pull 2.8 liters of water from the air over a 12-hour period."
3335,Computer Science and Engineering,"Reddit's bans of r/coontown and r/fatpeoplehate worked--many accounts of frequent posters on those subs were abandoned, and those who stayed reduced their use of hate speech"
3336,Astronomy,"Scientists conclude 13,000 years ago a 60 mile wide comet plunged Earth into a mini-Ice Age, after examining rocks from 170 sites around the globe"
3337,Computer Science and Engineering,"Most Cubans have no internet access, but get a rich variety of media and information in ""El Paquete"" (the weekly package), a 1 Tb collection of info distributed on USB keys. Selling EP is the largest occupation in Cuba, and challenges notions of how networks operate &amp; what they mean to citizens"
3338,Computer Science and Engineering,"Japanese scientists have invented a new loop-based quantum computing technique that renders a far larger number of calculations more efficiently than existing quantum computers, allowing a single circuit to process more than 1 million qubits theoretically, as reported in Physical Review Letters."
3339,Computer Science and Engineering,"Dragonfly wings naturally kill bacteria. At the molecular scale, they are composed of tiny ""beds of nails"" that use shear forces to physically rip bacteria apart."
3340,Computer Science and Engineering,"The first computer chip made with thousands of carbon nanotubes, not silicon, marks a computing milestone. Carbon nanotube chips may ultimately give rise to a new generation of faster, more energy-efficient electronics."
3341,Astronomy,"Astronomers discover that all disk galaxies rotate once every billion years, no matter their size or shape. Lead author: “Discovering such regularity in galaxies really helps us to better understand the mechanics that make them tick.”"
3342,Computer Science and Engineering,"Scientists developed a new electrochemical path to transform carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products such as jet fuel or plastics, from carbon that is already in the atmosphere, rather than from fossil fuels, a unique system that achieves 100% carbon utilization with no carbon is wasted."
3343,Astronomy,"A lake of liquid water may have been spotted on Mars. If confirmed, this would mark a new, potentially habitable environment in the solar system."
3344,Computer Science and Engineering,"A new lithium ion battery design for electric vehicles permits charging to 80% capacity in just ten minutes, adding 200 miles of range. Crucially, the batteries lasted for 2,500 charge cycles, equivalent to a 500,000-mile lifespan."
3345,Computer Science and Engineering,"AI equal with human experts in medical diagnosis based on images, suggests new study, which found deep learning systems correctly detected disease state 87% of the time, compared with 86% for healthcare professionals, and correctly gave all-clear 93% of the time, compared with 91% for human experts."
3346,Computer Science and Engineering,"Binghamton University researchers have been working on a self-healing concrete that uses a specific type of fungi as a healing agent. When the fungus is mixed with concrete, it lies dormant until cracks appear, when spores germinate, grow and precipitate calcium carbonate to heal the cracks."
3347,Computer Science and Engineering,"A chemistry professor in Florida has just found a way to trigger the process of photosynthesis in a synthetic material, turning greenhouse gases into clean air and producing energy all at the same time."
