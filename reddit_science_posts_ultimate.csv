1228,"Dogs may use Earth’s magnetic field to take shortcuts. Over 200 hunting dogs were set loose and tracked via GPS. In 170/223 trips, dogs stopped before returning and ran 20m along a N-S axis. When they did this, the dogs tended to get back to owner via a more direct route than when they did not.",Animal Science

Neural networks that become unstable after continuous periods of self-learning will return to stability after exposed to sleep like states, according to a study, suggesting that even artificial brains need to nap occasionally.",Computer Science and Engineering

1232,"Corvids, a group of birds that include jays, ravens, and crows, spend a lot of time under their parents' tutelage. Researchers have found that this may partially explain corvids have exceptional intelligence.",Animal Science
1233,"Equestrians might say they prefer 'predictable' male horses over females, despite no difference in their behavior while ridden. A new study based on ancient DNA from 100s of horse skeletons suggests that this bias started ~3.9k years ago when a new ""vision of gender"" emerged.",Animal Science
1234,"Scientists create a new, laser-driven light sail that can stabilize itself by diffracting light (therefore generating a sideways force), which prevents it from spiraling out of control as it travels through the solar system and beyond.",Astronomy
1235,"Scientists just found the crater from a huge asteroid impact that covered 10% of Earth's surface in debris 790,000 years ago. The crater was discovered beneath a plain of hardened lava in southern Laos, and the impact that caused it scattered special rocks, called tektites, from Asia to Antarctica.",Astronomy
1236,"Government labs set solar efficiency record, 50% efficient cell 'very achievable' - NREL researchers have designed a six bandgap, gallium arsenide, research cell that has researched 47.1% efficiency with a concentration of 143 suns. A standard sunlight model reached 39.2%.",Computer Science and Engineering

1241,"Scientists present first description of “wealth” inequality in a non-human animal, the hermit crab. The distribution of snail shells occupied by hermit crabs resembles human wealth distribution. The amount of inequality in crabs is more than in some small-scale human groups but less than in nations.",Computer Science and Engineering
